SQL Practice & Database Fundamentals – Daily Work Summary

This repository documents my day-wise SQL learning and hands-on practice using MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
The tasks focus on building strong fundamentals in database creation, data manipulation, and querying using real-world examples.

Day 1 – MySQL Setup & Database Creation

Installed MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench
Created a new database named student_db
Learned how to connect to the local MySQL instance
Understood basic database workflow in MySQL Workbench
Skills built: MySQL environment setup, database creation

 Day 2 – Table Creation & Data Insertion

Designed a students table with columns: enrollment_no, name, course,age
Inserted multiple sample student records (10+ entries)
Practiced structured and clean INSERT queries
Skills built: Table design, primary keys, INSERT operations

 Day 3 – Data Retrieval & Filtering (SELECT + WHERE)

Retrieved full table data using SELECT *
Applied filtering using WHERE clause:
Students older than 20
Students enrolled in a specific course
Names starting with a specific letter
Age range filtering using BETWEEN
Exact record search by name
Skills built: Data filtering, conditional querying

 Day 4 – Sorting, Limiting & Data Modification

Sorted data using ORDER BY:
Alphabetical order by name
Age-wise ascending and descending
Used LIMIT to fetch top youngest students
Updated student age and course using UPDATE
Deleted records using DELETE
Learned safe update mode and error handling
Skills built: ORDER BY, LIMIT, UPDATE, DELETE, error resolution

 Day 5 – Aggregate Functions & Practical Queries

Counted total number of students using COUNT(*)
Grouped students by course using GROUP BY
Found oldest and youngest students using MAX and MIN
Used LIKE operator for pattern-based searches
Understood difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column)
Skills built: Aggregation, grouping, analytical thinking

 Overall Learning Outcome

Strong understanding of SQL CRUD operations
Hands-on experience with real-world student data
Improved confidence in writing safe and accurate SQL queries
Practical exposure to database errors and recovery techniques
